### Making Changes

Once you have found an issue you want to work on, follow these steps to make changes:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your changes.
3. Make your changes to the codebase.
4. Add unit tests for your changes.
5. Commit your changes and push them to your fork.
6. Create a pull request against the upstream repository.


Once you have created a pull request, a maintainer will review your changes. If your changes are approved, they will be merged into the upstream repository.
